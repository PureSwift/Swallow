/** Manages a raw list of vertex information, allowing direct upload
to OpenGL vertex buffers.

To render objects with OpenGL, you have to organize vertex data in so-called
vertex buffers. Those buffers reside in graphics memory and can be accessed very
efficiently by the GPU. Before you can move data into vertex buffers, you have to
set it up in conventional memory - that is, in a byte array. That array contains
all vertex information (the coordinates, color, and texture coordinates) - one
vertex after the other.

To simplify creating and working with such a bulky list, `VertexData` was
created. It contains methods to specify and modify vertex data. The raw array managed
by the class can then easily be uploaded to a vertex buffer.

- Note: You only have to work with this class if you create display objects with a custom render
function. If you don't plan to do that, you can safely ignore it.

**Premultiplied Alpha**

The color values of texture files may contain premultiplied alpha values, which
means that the `RGB` values were multiplied with the `alpha` value
before saving them. On rendering, it makes a difference in which way the alpha value is saved;
for that reason, the VertexData class mimics this behavior. You can choose how the alpha
values should be handled via the `premultipliedAlpha` property.
